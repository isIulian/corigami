# Corigami - text/code folding extension

**Corigami** is a support tool to reveal the underling code structure in cases of formatting languages especially markup ones like HTML/XML.
It can be especially useful when working with web frameworks/libraries like Vue.js, React.js and more where the HTML structure is set aside in favour of decorations and declarations based on the framework.
The main reason for the development of the tool is to support a development friendly structure with easy code review on future rework.
